## Introduction
Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting material properties, owing to their inductive biases.  Nevertheless, the limited size of chemical datasets presents  substantial challenges for leveraging these architectures effectively. Here, we introduce a hybrid approach that aims at integrating the architectural biases of deep learning alongside the abstract knowledge provided by LLMs. Specifically, we utilize Roost (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19964-7), an attentional graph neural network for material property prediction that only leverages the stoichiometry of the underlying materials. We aggregate the material representations created by Roost with last layer embeddings provided by MatBert (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389922000733), a LLM fine-tuned on materials science literature.
